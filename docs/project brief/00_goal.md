# Project Goals

This document outlines the goals for the Personal Portfolio project. These goals are designed to align with the vision of the project and meet the technical requirements outlined by freeCodeCamp.

## 1. Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to create a simple, functional personal portfolio website that:
- Showcases projects and coursework completed during the learning journey.
- Highlights software engineering skills and personal achievements.
- Establishes an online presence with links to professional profiles and contact information.

## 2. Key Features

### Must-Have Features:

1. **Project Showcase:**
   - Display a list of projects, including coursework projects and personal initiatives.
   - Include links to GitHub repositories or live demos for each project.

2. **Professional Profiles:**
   - Provide links to GitHub, LinkedIn, freeCodeCamp, and other relevant platforms (e.g., HackerRank).

3. **Contact Information:**
   - Include an email address for direct communication.

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the website is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.

5. **Navigation:**
   - Implement a navbar for easy navigation between sections.

## 3. Alignment with freeCodeCamp Requirements

The portfolio will fulfill the following user stories and technical requirements:
- A welcome section with an `id` of `welcome-section` containing an `h1` element.
- A projects section with an `id` of `projects` that includes at least one project tile and links to projects.
- A navbar with an `id` of `navbar` that remains at the top of the viewport and contains links to navigate the page.
- A profile link with an `id` of `profile-link` that opens in a new tab.
- At least one media query for responsive design.
- A welcome section that spans the full height of the viewport.

## 4. Long-Term Goals

- Lay the foundation for future enhancements, such as adding a blog or interactive elements.
- Use this project as a stepping stone to develop advanced web development skills.

By achieving these goals, the Personal Portfolio project will serve as a strong representation of foundational web development skills and provide a platform for showcasing ongoing growth and achievements.
